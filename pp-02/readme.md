1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=1021n0k872Laa9E9u6gdG67iI8a
Your Rationale: I went for a simple black with a little red undertone.  I chose this because black as it is described in reading power elegance and formality.  The downside for most was also the reason i chose it. I thought it funny as evil and death was also corralated with black...and videogames are considered evil and make kids killers.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=52c0r0kyVppQzErJtuBLjrkS1qg
Your Rationale:Easy pallete to choose. Used a mixture of green and yellow.  Yellow being an energetic and green being growth.  These two together are perfect for a garden in spring time.  It is abrand new life and growing fastly.  This i feel gives off extatic growth.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=33K0T0knboys0A-qBu7uasy-QrY
Your Rationale: I felt that this pallete really showed kids learning the alphabet.  This was a fun palette beacuse i thought more about elementry and learning the alphabet.  This pallet gives the primary colors.  So it is like the first thing you learn in colors, kind of like first thing you learn is alpha bet.  Each could be put into how children act, yellow energetic, red fury, and light blue refreshing and friendly.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=a3I0U0kt+lZlOstrKqzzSiaJidt
Your Rationale:This final pallet i went for a simple darker blue with a golden accent.  This would be due to blue being described as reliable.  For cybersecurity I would imagine you want to give off relaible.  The golden brown i think will give off  the sense of permanance.
