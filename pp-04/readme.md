## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at
https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Android Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL):https://material.io/design/color/#color-theme-creation
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: I wanted a uniform color with a light and dark theme to it.  I chose to go dark and light green.  This could just as easily be swapped out with other colors as long as there is a dark and light according to color suggestions for android.  With this i made nav/notification bar darker green to distinguish it from the lighter primary content that would be following.  

* HCI Guideline Two (URL):https://material.io/design/components/bottom-navigation.html#theming
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:This guideline goes into how a bottom-nav should be formed.  The concept behind having 5 different tabs to go to in the website makes the bottom nav bar great!  With it I used active page has text and others just have an icon.  In the image I used black ink to show text under image, I would have them be a uniform color like the do of coloring nav.(following color scheme mentioned earlier)

* HCI Guideline Three (URL):https://material.io/design/communication/writing.html#content-structure
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:The discriptions were not as to the point as the guidance would push for.  What seemed liked a paragraph can be described with fewer words.  It also says to use 12345 instead of words discribing the numbers....i.e.one,two,three...  The entire wording could be restructured.  The main title for the content is also shortened in my sketch to illustrate the guideline of making the point(membership) and not needing to have multiple lines for the title(this could also be pointed towards topography selection)
